# Sewer Pipe Molotov
## Description
The most effective early aggro play for CTs on B is to take short/sewer control and put pressure on connector. This molotov either forces Ts to wait and give up the angles to the CTs or use a smoke to extinguish the molly and take a disadvantageous fight.

**Difficulty:** 2/5
**Importance:** 4/5
## Lineup
