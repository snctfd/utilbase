# Spawn Monster Smoke
## Description
Probably the most important piece of utility to throw on CT side Overpass. This smoke completely denies fast Monster plays from the Ts with just a single smoke grenade. Ideally throw this every single round unless you want to peek it with an AWP early in the round.

**Difficulty:** 2/5
**Importance:** 5/5
## Lineup
