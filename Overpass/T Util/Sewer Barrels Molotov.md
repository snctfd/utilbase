# Sewer Barrels Molotov
## Description
If only one molotov is available for an execute on B site Overpass, barrels is the optimal place to throw it, given that it is a very strong headshot angle for CTs and very hard to clear otherwise. This molotov can be thrown right after the [[Sewer Heaven Smoke]] from the same position.

**Difficulty:** 3/5
**Importance:** 4/5
## Lineup
Stand in the same position as you would be in for the Heaven smoke (this information is assumed to be known):

Aim at the line in the wood below the office container and find the area that has slightly more dark spots than the rest of the wood[^1] , then standing jump left click throw:

Result:

[^1]: If this is unclear, another way to line it up could be to draw down the middle of the white area on the container between the seams. Should be easy to tell after practicing though.
