# Dark Molotov
## Description
*AWP DARK AWP DARK AWP DARK*
In rifle vs. rifle duels dark is incredibly hard to clear, even worse, if a CT plays the position passively it takes a very long time to clear them out because Ts have to scale the entire bombsite before getting into the fight. Mollying it is a straightforward solution to this problem.

**Difficulty:** 1/5
**Importance:** 4/5
