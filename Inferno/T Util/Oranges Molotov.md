# Oranges Molotov
## Description
Both of the oranges positions are difficult to clear with just rifles, so this molotov provides a convenient way to push CTs out of those positions. In conjunction with the [[New Box Molotov]] the entire left side of the bombsite gets flushed out.

It is very easy to miss the position on top of second oranges, but being slightly off from the throw still covers both of the oranges on the ground itself, which is still fine. 

**Difficulty:** 5/5
**Importance:** 2/5

## Lineup
Wedge yourself into the car barrels as shown:

Find the second roof tile from the left and aim slightly above the right side of the intersection between the roof tile and the scaffolding. After that simply left click throw:

Missing the molotov *"correctly"* leads to the following spread:

Please note that intentionally aiming lower will eventually cause the molotov to miss the backside of first oranges, entirely defeating the point of the molotov.
