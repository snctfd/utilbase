# Sandwich Pop Flash
## Description
Simple pop flash perfect for peeking into enemies that are pushing into the site. If the enemy does not hear the sound of the flashbang bouncing, this flashbang is almost impossible to dodge and if thrown with good timing, will usually guarantee at least one kill.

Note however that this flash does not catch enemies that are partially behind the corner at top banana; for this reason it is recommended that you don't swing *too* wide with this flashbang. A  lineup where the flash pops wider could be used, but this would be more easily dodged by enemies that are closer.

**Difficulty:** 1/5
**Importance:** 4/5
## Lineup
Simply put your crosshair on the dot in the wood as shown, and left click throw
