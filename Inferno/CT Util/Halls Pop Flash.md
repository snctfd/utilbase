# Halls Pop Flash

## Description
Pop flash used to allow the balcony player to repeek the hallway in Apps. Many alternatives exist but this lineup is easy to remember and the flash is fully effective. Of note for this lineup specifically is that the thrower is not exposed to short, making it relatively low risk.

**Difficulty:** 1/5
**Importance:** 3/5
## Lineup
